Quick reference webpage for [Vainglory](http://www.vainglorygame.com) casters

Let's say you're shoutcasting a match and you want to have all the heroes' abilities and heroic perks right in front of you, for easy reference.
Sure, the pro casters have it all memorized, but if you're just starting out, you might need a little help.

So you [use this simple app](https://nathancarter.github.io/vg-caster-info/), add the heroes to the red and blue teams, and it's all right in front of your eyes.

Enjoy!
