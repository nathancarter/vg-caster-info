# Vainglory Caster Info

A quick-refernce webpage for amateur shoutcasters for the game [Vainglory](http://www.vainglorygame.com)

The web page lets you drag and drop names of heroes to form teams, and those teams contain very simple
reference information on each hero (name of heroic perk, A, B, and C abilities).

This site is built on a template from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/),
called [SB Admin](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/).

That template is Copyright 2013-2016 Blackrock Digital LLC.  Its code was released
